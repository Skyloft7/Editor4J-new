# Editor4J 2022.2




Editor4J is for anyone looking for a lightweight code-editor for teaching coding
in schools or learning individually. Professional IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse and NetBeans are great
but their features can sometimes make the experience more complicated, and you end up
spending time learning to use the IDE instead of Learning to code.

Editor4J *will* also add support for creating and taking courses uploaded by the community
or on a private server. 

#Update:

This project is currently "on the shelf", meaning development will be stopped for a while. Editor4J already implements 
many useful features and development did start for the 
course server. You can try it by running the Editor4J-CourseServer locally (make sure it's on port 9000), 
and then going to Courses/Course Explorer. It should return some sample
courses and it's description.

I'm not by any means looking to stop development on this project, but I need a break because
it's hard and stressful to work on things alone.
