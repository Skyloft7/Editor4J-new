# Editor4J 2022.4




Editor4J is for anyone looking for a lightweight code-editor for teaching coding
in schools or learning individually. Professional IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse and NetBeans are great
but their features can sometimes make the experience more complicated, and you end up
spending time learning to use the IDE instead of Learning to code.

Editor4J *will* also add support for creating and taking courses uploaded by the community
or on a private server.
